# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Facilitated by Scrum Master or Project Manager
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Include cross-functional perspectives (Development, UX, Security, Support, Data)
- Review metrics and data from the sprint/release (with Data Analyst input)

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items (use data and metrics)
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
- Encourage cross-functional collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Rotate facilitators to build shared ownership of process
- Review security, usability, and support metrics as part of improvement focus
